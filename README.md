# Non-coplanar-camera-calibration
Implemented non-coplanar camera calibration under the assumption of noisy data. Outliers were eliminated by Robust estimation through RANSAC algorithm determining intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Using the computed values 3D point was projected on to image plane
